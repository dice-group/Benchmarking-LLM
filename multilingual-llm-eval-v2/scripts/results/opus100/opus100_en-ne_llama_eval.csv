\item `scanf(""%d"", &n)` reads the number of columns from standard input and stores it in `n`. The `%d` format specifier is used to read an integer, which is then assigned to `n`, which is declared as an `int` variable. If the user does not enter a number, the program will terminate with an error message. This can be avoided by checking the return value of [`scanf()`](https://en.cppreference.",0.00,0.72

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item Use `str.translate(None, 'en', 'ne')` to translate from English to Nepalese. This will replace all occurrences of `'en'` with `'ne'`. Note that this is case-insensitive. If you want it to be case-sensitive, then use `'en_US'` instead of `'english'`, and `'ne_Nepalese'` for `'nepali'`.

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item `scanf(""%d"", &screen_number);` reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable screen_number. The format specifier `%d` expects an integer, so if the user enters anything other than an integer (e.g. a string or a floating point number), the program will not be able to read the input correctly.

\item Split the input string into words using `re.findall` and convert each word to lowercase using `str.lower()` function. This will give you a list of all the words in the sentence.

\item Use `str.translate(None, 'en', 'ne')` to replace all occurrences of `'en'` with `'ne'` in the string `str`. This will return a copy of `str` with all instances of `""en""` replaced with `""ne""`.

\item `make` is a shell built-in command, so you can't use it as a variable name. Use something else like `my_make` or `mymake` instead.
