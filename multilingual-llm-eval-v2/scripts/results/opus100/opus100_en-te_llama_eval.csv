The important thing is that it has the same number of syllables and vowels as the original English word. If you don't do this, your translation won't make sense.

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item Use `str.translate(None, 'en', 'te')` to replace all occurrences of `'en'` with `'te'`.
This will return a new string without `'en'`, which is what you want.
You can then use `str[::-1]` to reverse the order of the characters in the string.
Finally, you can use `reversed",0.00,0.32

Runway secure.,రన్వేసురక్షిత డ్యూక్:,"Runnan säkert.

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item `runway` is a noun, so it needs to be pluralized in the output.  This can be done by adding an `s` to the end of the word.
The same goes for `secure`, which is a verb.
You could also use the [pluralize](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.capitalize) method on the words, but that's not necessary here.
