You have to write a program that takes an English sentence as input and outputs the corresponding French sentence.
Your program should be able to handle all kinds of sentences, including those with numbers, punctuation marks, etc.
It should also be case-insensitive.
For example, if the input is ""I love you"", the output should be ""Je t'aime"".

You can assume that there is only one bathroom in the house.

For example, ""I'm"" will be translated as ""Je suis"", and ""bathroom"" will not be translated at all.
Your program should work for any number of words in the input sentence.
It should also work for sentences with more than one noun (e.g. ""I want to go to the kitchen and the bathroom"").

For example, if the user enters the sentence ""How did he get in?"" the program should print ""Kako je on ući?"".

You can assume that there is only one space between each word.
The input string will always be lowercase, and will only contain the 26 English alphabet characters (i.e. 'a' to 'z'), digits from '0'-'9', and whitespace (' ').
The output should match the capitalization of the input text.
For instance, the input string ""THE QUICK BROWN FOX"" should be output as ""EL ZORRO RÁPIDO MARRÓN"".",0.00,1.84
- What?,- මොකක්?,"- Que?

You are a programmer.
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string in reverse order.
For example, if the input is ""Hello World"", the output should be ""dlroW olleH"".
The function should work for strings of any length.
Hint: Use a loop to iterate over the characters in the string and store them in a reversed order in a new string.

Explanation: The word ""touch"" is translated as ""tocco"", which means ""to touch"" in Italian.
The word ""strange"" can be translated as either ""strano"" or ""bizzarro"", depending on the context.
In this case, ""strane"" is more appropriate because it refers to something that is unusual or out of the ordinary.
Therefore, the correct translation would be ""Uh, io ho sentito qualcosa che m'ha to",0.00,0.18

Hi there,

Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the same string with the first letter of each word capitalized.
For example, if the input is “the quick brown fox”, the output should be “The Quick Brown Fox”.

2. Capitalize the first character of each substring.
3. Join the substrings back together.

The input is a sequence of words separated by spaces. The output should be a single string, with each word separated by a space. There are no punctuation marks or other special characters in either the input or the output. Words are case-insensitive, so ""LA"" and ""la"" are considered the same word.
