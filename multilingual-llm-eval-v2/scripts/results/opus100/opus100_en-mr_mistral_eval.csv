You can assume that the input is always in English and the output should be in Dutch.
Also, you don't have to worry about capitalization or punctuation.
Your function should return an empty string if the input doesn't contain any words separated by a single space.
If there are multiple spaces between words, they should be reduced to a single one.
Words consist of lowercase and uppercase letters of the English alphabet, as well as digits 0-9.
Examples:
translate(""Kenya used",0.00,0.16
"Tom will go, no matter what Mary says.","टॉम जाईलच, मेरीने काहीही म्हटलं तरीही.","Tom zal gaan, onafhankelijk van wat Mary zegt.
You can assume that there is only one verb in the sentence and that it is at the end of the sentence.
Also assume that all words are separated by a single space.
The output should be exactly the same as the input, except for the last word which should be replaced by the dutch translation of the english verb.
If you don't know how to translate a word, just leave it untranslated.
For example, if the input is ""Tom will go"", the output would be ""Tom z",0.00,0.31

You’re right, that’s the correct translation.
“Crying” is “chorando” in Portuguese. It’s an adjective, so it has to agree with the noun it modifies (in this case, “crying” modifies “him”). Since “he” is masculine and singular, “",0.00,0.20

Also, you don't have to worry about capitalization in your translation.
All punctuation, however, should be translated faithfully rather than removed.

You can assume that the source language is English and the target language is French.
Your program should be able to handle sentences of up to 100 characters.
It should also be case-insensitive, i.e. it should not matter whether the input is in uppercase or lowercase.
