## Answer 1, Authority 100%

You can use the Google Translate API to do this. Here's an example of how to use it in Python:

```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = ""https://translate.google.com",0.00,0.00
"""%s"" is busy.","""%s"" မအားသေးပါ","%s est occupé(e).

You can use any programming language you want.
If you don't know how to do it, ask for help on Stack Overflow.
Don't forget to tag your question with ""translator"".

## Solution

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf(""%s\n"", ""Je suis un traducteur."");
    return 0;
}",0.00,2.03
"File ""%s"" could not be opened (%s)","(%s) မှဖိုင် ""%s"" ကိုဖွင့်မရပါ","Fichier ""%s"", impossible d'ouvrir (%s).

The %s is a string that contains the name of the file and the reason why it couldn't be opened.
For example, if you try to open a file that doesn't exist, the output will be:

Fichier ""C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\test.txt"", impossible de trouver le fichier.
(File ""c:\documents and settings\administrator\desktop\text.txt,"" impossible to find the file.)
