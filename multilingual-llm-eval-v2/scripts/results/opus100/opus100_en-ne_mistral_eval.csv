You are a programmer.
Write a function that converts an en string to a ne string.
The function should have the following signature:

def en_to_ne(en_string: str) -> str:

For example, if you call the function with the input ""Hello, world!"",

Write a function that takes two strings as arguments and returns true if they are anagrams of each other, false otherwise.
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrases, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \le a, b \le {10}^{18}$).
It is guaranteed that the sum of $a + b$ for all test cases does not exceed ${10}^9$.

For input = ""abcd"", the output should be
