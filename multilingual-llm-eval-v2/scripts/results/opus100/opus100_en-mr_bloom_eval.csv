Kenya used to be a British colony.,केनिया ब्रिटिश वसाहत असायची.,"Kenya is now a member state of the United Nations.

A:

I think you can do it in two steps. First, translate the whole sentence into English. Then, translate each word separately and put them back into the original sentence.
For example, if you want to translate this sentence into English:

Kenya was once part of the British Empire.

you can first translate it into English like this:

Kenya used to belong to the British empire.

Then, you can translate each individual word one by one:

Kenya
used to
belong
to
the
British
empire

Finally, put these words back into your original sentence:",0.00,0.14

Japan's most important opponent was China.,जपानचा सर्वात महत्त्वाचा प्रतिद्वंद्वी चीन होता.,"The most important enemy of Japan is China.

A:

I think you can do it in two steps. First, you need to split the sentence into two parts:

The most important
enemy of Japan
is China.

Then, you have to translate each part separately. For example, if you want to translate the first part, you can use:

日本の最も重要な敵は中国です。

If you wanted to translate both parts together, you could use something like this:

日本における最重要な敌は中国である。

You need to build a trie for each word, and then traverse the trie from the root node to the leaf node that corresponds to the target word.
