sentence = 'Porque yo creí en el Destino y la Suerte'

result = re.sub(r'\bDestino\b', 'Suerte', sentence)

I think you can do it in two steps. First, you need to find the word that is closest to the end of the sentence. In this case, it is ""regards"". Then, you just need to replace it with ""congratulate"". For example, if the sentence is:

Congratulate me on my birthday

you would translate it as:

The trick is to make sure that the translation of the whole sentence is grammatically correct. For example, if you want to translate ""No, Mom"" as ""ma'am"", you need to add a preposition before the word ""Mom"". In this case, I would use ""mama"" instead of ""Mom"":

Then, for each word in the sentence, you have to translate it into Si using the same method as above. For example:

I think you can do it in two steps. First, translate the first part of the sentence (input) to si and then translate the second part (output) from si back to en.
For example, if the input is ""yes, i called him"", the output would be ""no, i didnt call him"".

A:

I don't think you can do it in one go, but you can try to break it down into two steps.
First, you need to translate the first part of the sentence:

Nous prenons avantage de ceux qui pourraient nous donner quelque chose.

Then, you have to find a way to express the second part:

que nous aurions gagné quelque chose à partir d'eux.

Here is what I came up with:
