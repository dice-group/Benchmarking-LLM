You can assume that the input string is not empty and does not contain unprintable characters (such as backspace, form feed, newline, carriage return).

Examples:

translate(""Hello"") ===> ""Held""
translate (""Good job!"") ==> ""Good job!""

function translate(str) {

The input will always be ""Applet:"" and the output should be ""Yo:"" followed by the translated sentence.
