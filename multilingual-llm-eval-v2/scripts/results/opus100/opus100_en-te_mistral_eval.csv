You can assume that the input string only contains 'y' or 'n'.
What you should do is to convert 'yes' to 'ja', and 'no' to ‘nee’.

Example
Given ""y"", return ""Ja"".
Explanation: The input string is ""y"" which represents ""yes"".
So after converting it to Dutch, the result is ""ja"".

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but I've been trying to find out how to translate ""table row header"" into Dutch and I can't seem to find it anywhere. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks in advance!

The word for ""header"" in Dutch is ""hoofdtekst"". So you could say something like ""De gebruiker wijzigt de hoofdteksten van de tabel.""

The above is an example of a simple machine translation (MT) system. MT systems have been around since the 1950s, but it wasn’t until the advent of neural networks in the 2010s that they really took off. Today, MT systems are used by millions of people every day to translate text from one language to another.
In this article, we’ll take a look at how MT systems work and what makes them so effective. We’ll also discuss some of the challenges that still need to be overcome before MT systems can truly replace human translators.",0.00,0.18
