Comment: What have you tried so far?

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item `Failed to load '%s': %s` is a string, not a variable. So you can't use `%s` as a placeholder for a variable in your translation. Instead, you need to do something like this:

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item Use `str.title()` to get the title of the string.
`""Page"".title()` will give you ""Page"" in lower case.
If you want it in upper case, use `""Page"".upper()`
\strong{OR}
Use `str[0].upper() + str[1:]` to get just the first letter and the rest of the word in lowercase.
For example, if your string is ""Page"", then",0.00,0.00
