\item Split the input string on spaces, and get the first element of the resulting array (the ""name"" part). If it's empty, return an empty string. Otherwise, split it on underscores (`_`), and take the first character of the second element (the `n` part). Finally, join the two parts together with a space, and return that as the output.

\item Use `str.translate(to_unicode=True, from_codec='utf-8')` to convert your input string to unicode.
This will remove all non-ascii characters and replace them with their ascii equivalents.
For example, if your input is ""Name"", it will be converted to ""Naam"".

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item Use `str.translate(None, 'en', 'kn')` to convert the string from English to Norwegian. This will replace all occurrences of `'en'` with `'kn'`. Note that this is case-insensitive. If you want it to be case-sensitive, you can use `'en'.lower() + 'kn'.upper()` instead. See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#",0.00,0.00
