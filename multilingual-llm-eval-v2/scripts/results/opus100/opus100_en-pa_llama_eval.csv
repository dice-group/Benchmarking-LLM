Comment: What have you tried so far?

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item Use `input()` to get the user's input. This will return a string, which you can then convert to a `str` object using `str(input())`.
\strong{Note:} If you use `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, Python will automatically convert the input to a string for you. However, if you want to do it yourself, you need to use `input()`.

Then use `len()` to get the length of each word.
Finally, use `sum()` to sum up the lengths of all the words and return the result.
For example:
`""Size"".split("" "").map(len).sum()` will return 5.

\item Use `str.translate(None, 'äöüß')` to replace all special characters with their ASCII equivalents. This is necessary because Python's string type does not support non-ASCII characters natively.

\item Split the input string by `,` and store them in an array of strings (e.g. `input_array`). Then loop through the array and translate each string using `str_replace()` function as shown below:

$translated_array = array();

foreach ($input_string as $key => $value) {

$new_string = str_replace($key, $value, $",0.00,0.00

\item I'm not sure what you mean by ""professional translator"", but if you mean that you want to translate from one language to another, then you can use [gettext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html), which is part of the Python standard library.

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item Use `str.title()` to get the title of the string.
\strong{Note:} This will only work if the string has a title. If it does not have a title, then this will return an empty string. In that case, you can use `str[:-1]` to remove the last character from the string (which is the space after the title) and then use `capitalize()` to capitalize the first letter of the remaining string.
