You are a programmer.
Write a program that reads an English sentence as input and outputs the same sentence in Punjabi.
Your program should be able to handle sentences of any length.
It should also be case-insensitive, i.e., it should not matter whether the input is in uppercase or lowercase letters.
Finally, your program should output the translated sentence in one line, without any extra spaces or punctuation marks.
Here is an example of how your program might work:

```
$ python translate.py ""Hello, world!""",0.00,0.00
Name:,ਨਾਂ:,"Your name is ________.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but here it goes. I'm trying to translate an English sentence into Punjabi using Google Translate. However, when I try to translate the word ""name"" in Punjab, it doesn't seem to work. Is there any way to get around this? Thanks!

I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you want to do. Could you please explain it in more detail?

The input is a list of words (photo, video, webcam) and the output should be a list with the translated words (foto, videu, webkamerra).

You can use this code as a starting point:

```
from googletrans import Translator

def translate(word):
    # Replace 'en' with the source language and 'pa' with",0.00,11.98
"""%s"" cannot be unlocked","""%s"" ਅਣ-ਲਾਕ ਨਹੀਂ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾ ਸਕਦੀ","%s can't be opened

I don't know how to translate ""unlocked"" and ""can't"".

Thanks in advance!

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window.

Clear on Quit,ਬੰਦ ਕਰਨ ਸਮੇਂ ਸਾਫ਼ ਕਰੋ,"Cancel on Exit

I'm not sure what you mean by ""professional translator"", but I'll take a stab at it anyway. :)

""Clear"" and ""Quit"" are both verbs, so they should be in the infinitive form (i.e. without ""to""). The word ""on"" is an English preposition that doesn't really have a direct equivalent in other languages. In this case, it's being used as a conjunction to join two independent clauses, so we can replace it with the conjunction ""and"".

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but I'll try anyway. I'm looking for a way to translate an English sentence into another language using Python. Is there a library or module that can do this?

## Answer 1, Authority 100%

You can use the Google Translate API to translate text from one language to another. Here's an example of how to use it in Python:

```

You are a programmer.
Write a program that takes an English sentence as input and outputs the same sentence in Punjabi.
Your program should be able to handle sentences with any number of words.
It should also be case-insensitive, i.e., it should work for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
For example, if the input is ""Hello world!"", the output should be ""ਸ਼੍ਰੀ ਦੁਨਿਆ!""

The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ ($1\le T\le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

_Fast blanking,ਤੇਜ਼ ਖਾਲੀ ਕਰੋ(_F),"_Blanking fast

I'm not sure what you mean by ""professional translator"", but I'll give it a shot anyway. :)

The word ""fast"" is an adjective, so we need to put it before the noun it modifies. The word ""blanking"" is a verb, so it needs to go at the end of the sentence. We also need to make sure that the subject and verb agree in number (singular or plural).

Here's one possible translation:

You can assume that the input string is not empty and does not contain open or close brackets, except for those enclosed by the outermost parentheses. Your task is to translate the input in-place into output, that is, do not allocate any new memory.
Note: Do not use C++ standard library functions.
Example

For inputString = ""Hello World"", the output should be
translateInPlace(inputString) = ""Type Hello World"".

## Answer 1, authority 100%

There is no one-size-f",0.00,3.62
Source: %s,_ਸਰੋਤ,"Destination: %d

The input is a string and the output is an integer.
You can assume that the input will always be in the form of ""Source: xxx"" where xxx is a number between 1 and 1000.
The output should be the same as the input, but with the words ""Source"" and ""Destination"" swapped.
If the input is not in the correct format, you should return an empty string.
For example, if the input was ""Hello World"", the output would be ""World Hello"".",0.00,0.00
