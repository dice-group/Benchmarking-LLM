Is there a way to set the default language for the “file chooser” window?

I'm trying to translate a sentence from English to French, and I need some help with the translation of the word ""current"". In English, ""current"" can mean either ""present"" or ""flowing"", depending on the context. In French, however, there doesn't seem to be a single word that can cover both meanings. The closest I've been able to find is ""courant"", which seems to be used more",0.00,0.00

I have no idea how to do this. I'm not even sure if it's possible. The only thing I can think of is to create a dictionary with all the words and their translation, but that doesn't seem like a good solution. Is there any other way?

Thanks in advance!

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but here it goes. I'm working on a project that requires me to translate some text from English to Spanish and vice versa. The problem is that I don't know how to translate the word ""send"" into Spanish. I have tried using Google Translate, but it doesn't seem to work. Can anyone help me with this?

## What is the best way to translate from English to French?

There are many ways to translate text from one language to another. The most common method is to use a machine translation tool such as Google Translate or Bing Translator. However, these tools are not",0.00,0.00
"Can't rename file, filename already exists",دوتنه نه شي بيانومولی، دوتنه نوم د مخکې نه شته,"Impossible de renommer le fichier, le nom existe déja

You are a programmer.
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string in lowercase.
For example, if the input is ""HELLO WORLD"", the output should be ""hello world"".

Hint: Use the toLowerCase() method of the String class.
Example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(toLowerCase(""HELLOWORLD""));

You can assume that the input language is always English and the output language is Pig Latin.
Pig Latin takes the first letter of each word, moves it to the end of the word and adds ""ay"".

If a word starts with a vowel you just add ""way"" at the end.

The word “never” can be translated into Latin as “numquam.” This word is derived from the Latin phrase “non quam,” which means “not at all.” It is used to express the idea of something that will never happen or occur.",0.00,0.00
