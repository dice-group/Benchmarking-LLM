A:

I think you can do it in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of words in the input sentence. The idea is to build a trie for each word in the sentence, and then traverse the trie from left to right until we reach the end of the sentence. At that point, we have translated the whole sentence.
Here is an implementation in Python:
def translate(sentence):
    trie = {}
    for word in sentence:
        if word not in trie:
            trie[word] = [None] * (len(trie) + 1)",0.00,0.00

The idea is to split the input string on whitespace and then map each element to a function that replaces all leading and trailing whitespace with an empty string. Finally, we join the resulting list of functions with a single space.

This means that you need to find all the words that have the same meaning in both languages (in this case, release and rekonstrucja) and replace them with each other.

I think you can do it with a simple regex. The problem is that there is no space between the two words, so you need to use a negative lookbehind:

(?<!\s) - start of a word boundary (\W)

translate remember into kn;
translate view properties from English into kn by using Google Translate;
